## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 

### What I learned

In this project I learnt the ways in which I could customize lists and change their styles. As you can see in the code snippet below, I was able to change the style type of the lists, the colors, font size as well as their font family.

```css
ol li::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    font-weight:700;
    font-family: outfit, arial, sans-serif;
}

ul li::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    font-size: 0.8rem;
}

ul{
    list-style-type: square;
}
```

### Continued development

This challenge took me a bit longer to complete than the others I have done so far, but I find myself becoming more comfortable with using raw CSS. I'm excited to continue developing my knowledge and skills, and I'm hoping to utilise frameworks such as Bootstrap or Tailwind in my projects soon.
